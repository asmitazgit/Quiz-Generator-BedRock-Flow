**Quiz-Generator-BedROCK  Agent**

This project demonstrates how to build an AI workflow using the BedROCK. It leverages contextual information from documents stored in a vector database (Astra DB) and an LLM provider (NOVA) to dynamically generate multiple-choice quizzes.

**##Goal##**

The primary goal of this project is to:

Ingest domain-specific documents.

Use them as contextual knowledge for an LLM prompt.

Automatically generate a set of MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions) as a quiz.

Demonstrate an AI workflow where external knowledge retrieval, reasoning, and LLM inference are combined seamlessly.

**Solution Overview**

Document Ingestion: User-provided documents are uploaded and embedded into Astra Vector DB for efficient similarity search.

Query & Context Retrieval: At runtime, the system retrieves relevant document chunks based on the input query.

Prompt Assembly: The retrieved context is combined with the user query to form the final prompt.

LLM Inference: The prompt is sent to an LLM(NOVA Model) which is hosted via BedROCK Agent, which generates a structured set of MCQs.

Output Delivery: The generated quiz is returned in a human-readable format.

User ‚Üí Bedrock Flow ‚Üí Lambda Function ‚Üí AstraDB ‚Üí Bedrock Agent ‚Üí Foundation Model ‚Üí Quiz Output

### üîπ How It Works
1. The **user** provides a topic, difficulty, and number of questions.
2. The **Bedrock Flow** triggers a **Lambda function** (via Action Group).
3. The Lambda queries **AstraDB** (using the DataStax REST API) to retrieve context or study material.
4. The retrieved text is sent back to the **Bedrock Agent**.
5. The Agent prompts a **Foundation Model** (NOVA Model or Claude or Tital depends on which LLM model u have selected) to generate a multiple-choice quiz.
6. The Flow outputs a structured JSON quiz result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- AWS account with **Amazon Bedrock** enabled.
- **AstraDB** account and keyspace created.
- AWS CLI or CloudShell installed.
- IAM permissions for:
  - `bedrock:*`
  - `lambda:*`
  - `iam:PassRole`

---

### 2. Configure AstraDB
1. Log in to [AstraDB](https://astra.datastax.com/).
2. Create a **database** and note:
   - Database ID
   - Keyspace name
   - Application Token (with API access)
3. Create a collection or table for your knowledge base:
  
4.	Insert some learning content relevant to quiz topics.
________________________________________
3. Create Lambda Function
lambda/handler.py
import json
import requests
import os

ASTRA_DB_URL = os.environ["ASTRA_DB_URL"]
ASTRA_DB_TOKEN = os.environ["ASTRA_DB_TOKEN"]

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    topic = event.get("topic", "general knowledge")
    difficulty = event.get("difficulty", "medium")

    headers = {
        "x-cassandra-token": ASTRA_DB_TOKEN,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    query = {"find": {"topic": topic}}
    response = requests.post(f"{ASTRA_DB_URL}/api/rest/v2/keyspaces/quiz_keyspace/quiz_knowledge/find", 
                             headers=headers, json=query)
    data = response.json()
    content = data["data"][0]["content"] if data["data"] else "No content found."

    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": json.dumps({
            "topic": topic,
            "difficulty": difficulty,
            "context": content
        })
    }
Lambda Configuration
Set environment variables:
‚Ä¢	ASTRA_DB_URL
‚Ä¢	ASTRA_DB_TOKEN
Deploy via AWS Console or SAM:

4. Create Bedrock Agent
1.	Go to Amazon Bedrock ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Create Agent.
2.	Select a Foundation Model (e.g., Claude 3 Sonnet or Titan Text).
3.	Define the prompt template:
4.	You are a Quiz Generator Agent.
5.	Generate {question_count} multiple-choice questions from the provided context.
6.	Topic: {topic}
7.	Difficulty: {difficulty}
8.	Include four options per question and indicate the correct one.
9.	Add an Action Group ‚Üí Connect the Lambda function created above.
o	Input schema:
o	{
o	  "topic": "string",
o	  "difficulty": "string"
o	}
10.	Publish a version and create an alias (e.g., quiz-agent-v1).
________________________________________
5. Import Bedrock Flow
1.	Go to Amazon Bedrock ‚Üí Flows ‚Üí Create Flow ‚Üí Import from file.
2.	Upload flows/quiz-flow.json from this repo.
3.	Configure the Flow nodes:
o	Agent Node ‚Üí select Quiz-Generator-Agent
o	Agent Alias ‚Üí select quiz-agent-v1
4.	Save and test the flow.

üßæ Example Usage
Input:
Create a 5-question quiz on ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù with medium difficulty.
Lambda Output (to Agent):
{
  "topic": "Machine Learning",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "context": "Machine learning enables systems to learn from data..."
}
Final Quiz Output:
{
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What does supervised learning use for training?",
      "options": ["Unlabeled data", "Labeled data", "No data", "Reinforcement signals"],
      "answer": "Labeled data"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which algorithm is used for classification?",
      "options": ["K-Means", "Linear Regression", "Decision Tree", "PCA"],
      "answer": "Decision Tree"
